# Goa Tourism Interactive Dashboard

## Problem Statement
Tourism is a key driver of Goa's economy, but understanding visitor trends, spending patterns, and preferences requires clear visualization of data.

- Analyzed tourist demographics, travel behavior, booking preferences, and spending patterns.
- Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard with filters and KPIs.
- Highlighted insights for improving tourism strategies and supporting local artisan communities.

## Tools & Technologies Used
